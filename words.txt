Coronaviruses are a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds In humans and birds they cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal Mild illnesses in humans include some cases of the common cold which is also caused by other viruses predominantly rhinoviruses while more lethal varieties can cause SARS MERS and COVID In cows and pigs they cause diarrhea while in mice they cause hepatitis and encephalomyelitis Coronaviruses constitute the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae in the family Coronaviridae order Nidovirales and realm Riboviria They are enveloped viruses with a positive sense single stranded RNA genome and a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry The genome size of coronaviruses ranges from approximately to kilobases one of the largest among RNA viruses They have characteristic club shaped spikes that project from their surface which in electron micrographs create an image reminiscent of the solar corona from which their name derives Etymology The name coronavirus is derived from Latin corona meaning crown or wreath itself a borrowing from Greek kor n garland wreath The name was coined by June Almeida and David Tyrrell who first observed and studied human coronaviruses The word was first used in print in by an informal group of virologists in the journal Nature to designate the new family of viruses The name refers to the characteristic appearance of virions the infective form of the virus by electron microscopy which have a fringe of large bulbous surface projections creating an image reminiscent of the solar corona or halo This morphology is created by the viral spike peplomers which are proteins on the surface of the virus The scientific name Coronavirus was accepted as a genus name by the International Committee for the Nomenclature of Viruses later renamed International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses in As the number of new species increased the genus was split into four genera namely Alphacoronavirus Betacoronavirus Deltacoronavirus and Gammacoronavirus in The common name coronavirus is used to refer to any member of the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae As of species are officially recognised History The earliest reports of a coronavirus infection in animals occurred in the late s when an acute respiratory infection of domesticated chickens emerged in North America Arthur Schalk and M C Hawn in made the first detailed report which described a new respiratory infection of chickens in North Dakota The infection of new born chicks was characterized by gasping and listlessness with high mortality rates of Leland David Bushnell and Carl Alfred Brandly isolated the virus that caused the infection in The virus was then known as infectious bronchitis virus IBV Charles D Hudson and Fred Robert Beaudette cultivated the virus for the first time in The specimen came to be known as the Beaudette strain In the late s two more animal coronaviruses JHM that causes brain disease murine encephalitis and mouse hepatitis virus MHV that causes hepatitis in mice were discovered It was not realized at the time that these three different viruses were related Human coronaviruses were discovered in the s using two different methods in the United Kingdom and the United States E C Kendall Malcolm Bynoe and David Tyrrell working at the Common Cold Unit of the British Medical Research Council collected a unique common cold virus designated B in The virus could not be cultivated using standard techniques which had successfully cultivated rhinoviruses adenoviruses and other known common cold viruses In Tyrrell and Bynoe successfully cultivated the novel virus by serially passing it through organ culture of human embryonic trachea The new cultivating method was introduced to the lab by Bertil Hoorn The isolated virus when intranasally inoculated into volunteers caused a cold and was inactivated by ether which indicated it had a lipid envelope Dorothy Hamre and John Procknow at the University of Chicago isolated a novel cold from medical students in They isolated and grew the virus in kidney tissue culture designating it E The novel virus caused a cold in volunteers and like B was inactivated by ether Scottish virologist June Almeida at St Thomas Hospital in London collaborating with Tyrrell compared the structures of IBV B and E in Using electron microscopy the three viruses were shown to be morphologically related by their general shape and distinctive club like spikes A research group at the National Institute of Health the same year was able to isolate another member of this new group of viruses using organ culture and named one of the samples OC OC for organ culture Like B E and IBV the novel cold virus OC had distinctive club like spikes when observed with the electron microscope The IBV like novel cold viruses were soon shown to be also morphologically related to the mouse hepatitis virus This new group of viruses were named coronaviruses after their distinctive morphological appearance Human coronavirus E and human coronavirus OC continued to be studied in subsequent decades The coronavirus strain B was lost It is not known which present human coronavirus it was Other human coronaviruses have since been identified including SARS CoV in HCoV NL in HCoV HKU in MERS CoV in and SARS CoV in There have also been a large number of animal coronaviruses identified since the s Microbiology Structure Coronaviruses are large roughly spherical particles with unique surface projections Their size is highly variable with average diameters of to nm Extreme sizes are known from to nm in diameter The total molecular mass is on average kDa They are enclosed in an envelope embedded with a number of protein molecules The lipid bilayer envelope membrane proteins and nucleocapsid protect the virus when it is outside the host cell The viral envelope is made up of a lipid bilayer in which the membrane M envelope E and spike S structural proteins are anchored The molar ratio of E S M in the lipid bilayer is approximately The E and M protein are the structural proteins that combined with the lipid bilayer to shape the viral envelope and maintain its size S proteins are needed for interaction with the host cells But human coronavirus NL is peculiar in that its M protein has the binding site for the host cell and not its S protein The diameter of the envelope is nm The envelope of the virus in electron micrographs appears as a distinct pair of electron dense shells shells that are relatively opaque to the electron beam used to scan the virus particle The M protein is the main structural protein of the envelope that provides the overall shape and is a type III membrane protein It consists of to amino acid residues and forms a layer nm thick It has three domains a short N terminal ectodomain a triple spanning transmembrane domain and a C terminal endodomain The C terminal domain forms a matrix like lattice that adds to the extra thickness of the envelope Different species can have either N or O linked glycans in their protein amino terminal domain The M protein is crucial during the assembly budding envelope formation and pathogenesis stages of the virus lifecycle The E proteins are minor structural proteins and highly variable in different species There are only about copies of the E protein molecule in a coronavirus particle They are to kDa in size and are composed of to amino acids They are integral proteins i e embedded in the lipid layer and have two domains namely a transmembrane domain and an extramembrane C terminal domain They are almost fully helical with a single helical transmembrane domain and form pentameric five molecular ion channels in the lipid bilayer They are responsible for virion assembly intracellular trafficking and morphogenesis budding The spikes are the most distinguishing feature of coronaviruses and are responsible for the corona or halo like surface On average a coronavirus particle has surface spikes Each spike is about nm long and is composed of a trimer of the S protein The S protein is in turn composed of an S and S subunit The homotrimeric S protein is a class I fusion protein which mediates the receptor binding and membrane fusion between the virus and host cell The S subunit forms the head of the spike and has the receptor binding domain RBD The S subunit forms the stem which anchors the spike in the viral envelope and on protease activation enables fusion The two subunits remain noncovalently linked as they are exposed on the viral surface until they attach to the host cell membrane In a functionally active state three S are attached to two S subunits The subunit complex is split into individual subunits when the virus binds and fuses with the host cell under the action of proteases such as cathepsin family and transmembrane protease serine TMPRSS of the host cell S proteins are the most critical components in terms of infection They are also the most variable components as they are responsible for host cell specificity They possess two major domains named N terminal domain S NTD and C terminal domain S CTD both of which serve as the receptor binding domains The NTDs recognize and bind sugars on the surface of the host cell An exception is the MHV NTD that binds to a protein receptor carcinoembryonic antigen related cell adhesion molecule CEACAM S CTDs are responsible for recognizing different protein receptors such as angiotensin converting enzyme ACE aminopeptidase N APN and dipeptidyl peptidase DPP A subset of coronaviruses specifically the members of betacoronavirus subgroup A also has a shorter spike like surface protein called hemagglutinin esterase HE The HE proteins occur as homodimers composed of about amino acid residues and are to kDa in size They appear as tiny surface projections of to nm long embedded in between the spikes They help in the attachment to and detachment from the host cell Inside the envelope there is the nucleocapsid which is formed from multiple copies of the nucleocapsid N protein which are bound to the positive sense single stranded RNA genome in a continuous beads on a string type conformation N protein is a phosphoprotein of to kDa in size and is divided into three conserved domains The majority of the protein is made up of domains and which are typically rich in arginines and lysines Domain has a short carboxy terminal end and has a net negative charge due to excess of acidic over basic amino acid residues Genome Coronaviruses contain a positive sense single stranded RNA genome The genome size for coronaviruses ranges from to kilobases The genome size is one of the largest among RNA viruses The genome has a methylated cap and a polyadenylated tail The genome organization for a coronavirus is leader UTR replicase ORF ab spike S envelope E membrane M nucleocapsid N UTR poly A tail The open reading frames a and b which occupy the first two thirds of the genome encode the replicase polyprotein pp ab The replicase polyprotein self cleaves to form nonstructural proteins nsp nsp The later reading frames encode the four major structural proteins spike envelope membrane and nucleocapsid Interspersed between these reading frames are the reading frames for the accessory proteins The number of accessory proteins and their function is unique depending on the specific coronavirus Replication cycle Cell entry Infection begins when the viral spike protein attaches to its complementary host cell receptor After attachment a protease of the host cell cleaves and activates the receptor attached spike protein Depending on the host cell protease available cleavage and activation allows the virus to enter the host cell by endocytosis or direct fusion of the viral envelope with the host membrane Genome translation On entry into the host cell the virus particle is uncoated and its genome enters the cell cytoplasm The coronavirus RNA genome has a methylated cap and a polyadenylated tail which allows it to act like a messenger RNA and be directly translated by the host cell s ribosomes The host ribosomes translate the initial overlapping open reading frames ORF a and ORF b of the virus genome into two large overlapping polyproteins pp a and pp ab The larger polyprotein pp ab is a result of a ribosomal frameshift caused by a slippery sequence UUUAAAC and a downstream RNA pseudoknot at the end of open reading frame ORF a The ribosomal frameshift allows for the continuous translation of ORF a followed by ORF b The polyproteins have their own proteases PLpro nsp and CLpro nsp which cleave the polyproteins at different specific sites The cleavage of polyprotein pp ab yields nonstructural proteins nsp to nsp Product proteins include various replication proteins such as RNA dependent RNA polymerase nsp RNA helicase nsp and exoribonuclease nsp Replicase transcriptase A number of the nonstructural proteins coalesce to form a multi protein replicase transcriptase complex The main replicase transcriptase protein is the RNA dependent RNA polymerase RdRp It is directly involved in the replication and transcription of RNA from an RNA strand The other nonstructural proteins in the complex assist in the replication and transcription process The exoribonuclease nonstructural protein for instance provides extra fidelity to replication by providing a proofreading function which the RNA dependent RNA polymerase lacks Replication One of the main functions of the complex is to replicate the viral genome RdRp directly mediates the synthesis of negative sense genomic RNA from the positive sense genomic RNA This is followed by the replication of positive sense genomic RNA from the negative sense genomic RNA Transcription The other important function of the complex is to transcribe the viral genome RdRp directly mediates the synthesis of negative sense subgenomic RNA molecules from the positive sense genomic RNA This process is followed by the transcription of these negative sense subgenomic RNA molecules to their corresponding positive sense mRNAs The subgenomic mRNAs form a nested set which have a common head and partially duplicate end Recombination The replicase transcriptase complex is also capable of genetic recombination when at least two viral genomes are present in the same infected cell RNA recombination appears to be a major driving force in determining genetic variability within a coronavirus species the capability of a coronavirus species to jump from one host to another and infrequently in determining the emergence of novel coronaviruses The exact mechanism of recombination in coronaviruses is unclear but likely involves template switching during genome replication Assembly and release The replicated positive sense genomic RNA becomes the genome of the progeny viruses The mRNAs are gene transcripts of the last third of the virus genome after the initial overlapping reading frame These mRNAs are translated by the host s ribosomes into the structural proteins and many accessory proteins RNA translation occurs inside the endoplasmic reticulum The viral structural proteins S E and M move along the secretory pathway into the Golgi intermediate compartment There the M proteins direct most protein protein interactions required for the assembly of viruses following its binding to the nucleocapsid Progeny viruses are then released from the host cell by exocytosis through secretory vesicles Once released the viruses can infect other host cells Transmission Infected carriers are able to shed viruses into the environment The interaction of the coronavirus spike protein with its complementary cell receptor is central in determining the tissue tropism infectivity and species range of the released virus Coronaviruses mainly target epithelial cells They are transmitted from one host to another host depending on the coronavirus species by either an aerosol fomite or fecal oral route Human coronaviruses infect the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract while animal coronaviruses generally infect the epithelial cells of the digestive tract SARS coronavirus for example infects the human epithelial cells of the lungs via an aerosol route by binding to the angiotensin converting enzyme ACE receptor Transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus TGEV infects the pig epithelial cells of the digestive tract via a fecal oral route by binding to the alanine aminopeptidase APN receptor Classification Coronaviruses form the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae which is one of two sub families in the family Coronaviridae order Nidovirales and realm Riboviria They are divided into the four genera Alphacoronavirus Betacoronavirus Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus Alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses infect mammals while gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses primarily infect birds Genus Alphacoronavirus Species Alphacoronavirus TGEV Feline coronavirus Canine coronavirus Human coronavirus E Human coronavirus NL Miniopterus bat coronavirus Miniopterus bat coronavirus HKU Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus Rhinolophus bat coronavirus HKU Scotophilus bat coronavirus Genus Betacoronavirus Species Betacoronavirus Bovine Coronavirus Human coronavirus OC Hedgehog coronavirus Human coronavirus HKU Middle East respiratory syndrome related coronavirus Murine coronavirus Pipistrellus bat coronavirus HKU Rousettus bat coronavirus HKU Severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronavirus SARS CoV SARS CoV Tylonycteris bat coronavirus HKU Genus Gammacoronavirus Species Avian coronavirus Beluga whale coronavirus SW Genus Deltacoronavirus Species Bulbul coronavirus HKU Porcine coronavirus HKU Origin The most recent common ancestor MRCA of all coronaviruses is estimated to have existed as recently as BCE although some models place the common ancestor as far back as million years or more implying long term coevolution with bat and avian species The most recent common ancestor of the alphacoronavirus line has been placed at about BCE of the betacoronavirus line at BCE of the gammacoronavirus line at BCE and the deltacoronavirus line at about BCE Bats and birds as warm blooded flying vertebrates are an ideal natural reservoir for the coronavirus gene pool with bats the reservoir for alphacoronaviruses and betacoronavirus and birds the reservoir for gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses The large number and global range of bat and avian species that host viruses have enabled extensive evolution and dissemination of coronaviruses Many human coronaviruses have their origin in bats The human coronavirus NL shared a common ancestor with a bat coronavirus ARCoV between and CE The human coronavirus E shared a common ancestor with a bat coronavirus GhanaGrp Bt CoV between and CE More recently alpaca coronavirus and human coronavirus E diverged sometime before MERS CoV emerged in humans from bats through the intermediate host of camels MERS CoV although related to several bat coronavirus species appears to have diverged from these several centuries ago The most closely related bat coronavirus and SARS CoV diverged in The ancestors of SARS CoV first infected leaf nose bats of the genus Hipposideridae subsequently they spread to horseshoe bats in the species Rhinolophidae then to Asian palm civets and finally to humans Unlike other betacoronaviruses bovine coronavirus of the species Betacoronavirus and subgenus Embecovirus is thought to have originated in rodents and not in bats In the s equine coronavirus diverged from the bovine coronavirus after a cross species jump Later in the s human coronavirus OC diverged from bovine coronavirus after another cross species spillover event It is speculated that the flu pandemic of may have been caused by this spillover event and not by the influenza virus because of the related timing neurological symptoms and unknown causative agent of the pandemic Besides causing respiratory infections human coronavirus OC is also suspected of playing a role in neurological diseases In the s the human coronavirus OC began to diverge into its present genotypes Phylogenetically mouse hepatitis virus Murine coronavirus which infects the mouse s liver and central nervous system is related to human coronavirus OC and bovine coronavirus Human coronavirus HKU like the aforementioned viruses also has its origins in rodents Infection in humans Coronaviruses vary significantly in risk factor Some can kill more than of those infected such as MERS CoV and some are relatively harmless such as the common cold Coronaviruses can cause colds with major symptoms such as fever and a sore throat from swollen adenoids Coronaviruses can cause pneumonia either direct viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia and bronchitis either direct viral bronchitis or secondary bacterial bronchitis The human coronavirus discovered in SARS CoV which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS has a unique pathogenesis because it causes both upper and lower respiratory tract infections Six species of human coronaviruses are known with one species subdivided into two different strains making seven strains of human coronaviruses altogether Four human coronaviruses produce symptoms that are generally mild even though it is contended they might have been more aggressive in the past Human coronavirus OC HCoV OC CoV Human coronavirus HKU HCoV HKU CoV Human coronavirus E HCoV E CoV Human coronavirus NL HCoV NL CoVThree human coronaviruses produce potentially severe symptoms Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS CoV CoV identified in Middle East respiratory syndrome related coronavirus MERS CoV CoV identified in Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS CoV CoV identified in These cause the diseases commonly called SARS MERS and COVID respectively Common cold Although the common cold is usually caused by rhinoviruses in about of cases the cause is a coronavirus The human coronaviruses HCoV OC HCoV HKU HCoV E and HCoV NL continually circulate in the human population in adults and children worldwide and produce the generally mild symptoms of the common cold The four mild coronaviruses have a seasonal incidence occurring in the winter months in temperate climates There is no preponderance in any season in tropical climates Severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS In following the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS which had begun the prior year in Asia and secondary cases elsewhere in the world the World Health Organization WHO issued a press release stating that a novel coronavirus identified by several laboratories was the causative agent for SARS The virus was officially named the SARS coronavirus SARS CoV More than people from different countries and territories were infected and at least died Middle East respiratory syndrome MERS In September a new type of coronavirus was identified initially called Novel Coronavirus and now officially named Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus MERS CoV The World Health Organization issued a global alert soon after The WHO update on September said the virus did not seem to pass easily from person to person However on May a case of human to human transmission in France was confirmed by the French Ministry of Social Affairs and Health In addition cases of human to human transmission were reported by the Ministry of Health in Tunisia Two confirmed cases involved people who seemed to have caught the disease from their late father who became ill after a visit to Qatar and Saudi Arabia Despite this it appears the virus had trouble spreading from human to human as most individuals who are infected do not transmit the virus By October there were cases and deaths in Saudi Arabia After the Dutch Erasmus Medical Centre sequenced the virus the virus was given a new name Human Coronavirus Erasmus Medical Centre HCoV EMC The final name for the virus is Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus MERS CoV The only U S cases both survived were recorded in May In May an outbreak of MERS CoV occurred in the Republic of Korea when a man who had traveled to the Middle East visited four hospitals in the Seoul area to treat his illness This caused one of the largest outbreaks of MERS CoV outside the Middle East As of December cases of MERS CoV infection had been confirmed by laboratory tests of which were fatal a mortality rate of approximately Coronavirus disease COVID In December a pneumonia outbreak was reported in Wuhan China On December the outbreak was traced to a novel strain of coronavirus which was given the interim name nCoV by the World Health Organization WHO later renamed SARS CoV by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses As of September there have been at least confirmed deaths and more than confirmed cases in the COVID pandemic The Wuhan strain has been identified as a new strain of Betacoronavirus from group B with approximately genetic similarity to the SARS CoV The virus has a similarity to a bat coronavirus so it is widely suspected to originate from bats as well Coronavirus HuPn During a surveillance study of archived samples of Malaysian viral pneumonia patients virologists identified a strain of canine coronavirus which has infected humans in Infection in animals Coronaviruses have been recognized as causing pathological conditions in veterinary medicine since the s They infect a range of animals including swine cattle horses camels cats dogs rodents birds and bats The majority of animal related coronaviruses infect the intestinal tract and are transmitted by a fecal oral route Significant research efforts have been focused on elucidating the viral pathogenesis of these animal coronaviruses especially by virologists interested in veterinary and zoonotic diseases Farm animals Coronaviruses infect domesticated birds Infectious bronchitis virus IBV a type of coronavirus causes avian infectious bronchitis The virus is of concern to the poultry industry because of the high mortality from infection its rapid spread and its effect on production The virus affects both meat production and egg production and causes substantial economic loss In chickens infectious bronchitis virus targets not only the respiratory tract but also the urogenital tract The virus can spread to different organs throughout the chicken The virus is transmitted by aerosol and food contaminated by feces Different vaccines against IBV exist and have helped to limit the spread of the virus and its variants Infectious bronchitis virus is one of a number of strains of the species Avian coronavirus Another strain of avian coronavirus is turkey coronavirus TCV which causes enteritis in turkeys Coronaviruses also affect other branches of animal husbandry such as pig farming and the cattle raising Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus SADS CoV which is related to bat coronavirus HKU causes diarrhea in pigs Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus PEDV is a coronavirus that has recently emerged and similarly causes diarrhea in pigs Transmissible gastroenteritis virus TGEV which is a member of the species Alphacoronavirus is another coronavirus that causes diarrhea in young pigs In the cattle industry bovine coronavirus BCV which is a member of the species Betacoronavirus and related to HCoV OC is responsible for severe profuse enteritis in young calves Domestic pets Coronaviruses infect domestic pets such as cats dogs and ferrets There are two forms of feline coronavirus which are both members of the species Alphacoronavirus Feline enteric coronavirus is a pathogen of minor clinical significance but spontaneous mutation of this virus can result in feline infectious peritonitis FIP a disease with high mortality There are two different coronaviruses that infect dogs Canine coronavirus CCoV which is a member of the species Alphacoronavirus causes mild gastrointestinal disease Canine respiratory coronavirus CRCoV which is a member of the species Betacoronavirus and related to HCoV OC cause respiratory disease Similarly there are two types of coronavirus that infect ferrets Ferret enteric coronavirus causes a gastrointestinal syndrome known as epizootic catarrhal enteritis ECE and a more lethal systemic version of the virus like FIP in cats known as ferret systemic coronavirus FSC Laboratory animals Coronaviruses infect laboratory animals Mouse hepatitis virus MHV which is a member of the species Murine coronavirus causes an epidemic murine illness with high mortality especially among colonies of laboratory mice Prior to the discovery of SARS CoV MHV was the best studied coronavirus both in vivo and in vitro as well as at the molecular level Some strains of MHV cause a progressive demyelinating encephalitis in mice which has been used as a murine model for multiple sclerosis Sialodacryoadenitis virus SDAV which is a strain of the species Murine coronavirus is highly infectious coronavirus of laboratory rats which can be transmitted between individuals by direct contact and indirectly by aerosol Rabbit enteric coronavirus causes acute gastrointestinal disease and diarrhea in young European rabbits Mortality rates are high Prevention and treatment A number of vaccines using different methods have been developed against human coronavirus SARS CoV Antiviral targets against human coronaviruses have also been identified such as viral proteases polymerases and entry proteins Drugs are in development which target these proteins and the different steps of viral replication Vaccines are available for animal coronaviruses IBV TGEV and Canine CoV although their effectiveness is limited In the case of outbreaks of highly contagious animal coronaviruses such as PEDV measures such as destruction of entire herds of pigs may be used to prevent transmission to other herds See also Coronavirus diseases Zoonosis References Further reading
